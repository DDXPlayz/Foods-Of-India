<font size="5"><p><b>Pav bhaji</b> is a spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy served with bread.<br> Vegetables in the curry may commonly include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, <br>bell peppers and tomatoes. Street sellers usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava)<br> and serve the dish hot.</p></font>
<h2><br><br>Who Invented Pav Bhaji?</h2><font size="5"><p>The origin of this dish traces back to textile mill workers in Mumbai in the 1850s.<br> They had lunch breaks too short for a full meal, and a light lunch was preferred to a heavy one,<br> as the employees had to return to strenuous physical labor after lunch.</p></font>
