<font size="5"><p><b>Biryani</b> is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.<br> It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat usually that of chicken, goat, lamb, prawn, fish, and <br>sometimes, in addition, eggs or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties.</p></font>
<h2><br><br>Why is biryani famous?</h2><font size="5"><p>Originally from Persia, and introduced in India by Mughal rulers, the dish is a delight to eat <br>and a challenge for chefs to prepare. In a perfect pot of biryani, every grain of rice is separate,<br>yet infused with aromas of various spices and has meat or vegetables paired with it.</p></font>
